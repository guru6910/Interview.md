1. what is SDLC (software development life cycle) ?

Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process used for software Delivery. The goal of SDLC is to deliver high-quality software that meets customer requirements within a specified timeline and budget. In SDLC common stages are to Define the project's scope, goals, resources, and risks then Requirement for knowing business and technical requirements for the software. later Design in that Create the architecture and detailed design of the software, including databases, interfaces, and system logic then Implementation (Development) to Write the actual code based on the design specifications. then Testing to Test the software for defects, bugs, and ensure it meets the requirements. then after Deployment means Release the software to the production environment for users and Last is Monitoring in that Provide ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to improve performance or add new features.

2. explain waterfall methodology.

The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach to software development. In this model each phase the project is completed one by one with no overlap. once the phase is finished you move to the next stage and you cant go back to previous phase easily.

3. Explain Agile methodology.

The Agile methodology is a flexible approach to software development where projects are divided into small, manageable parts called sprints. Teams work in short cycles to create and improve the product based on regular feedback from customers, allowing them to adapt to changes quickly. This helps ensure that the final product better meets user needs.

4. Explain Devops.

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to improve collaboration, automate processes, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software. It aims to shorten development cycles and enhance deployment frequency through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

5. what work of devlopers and operations ?

Developers focus on writing code, building features, and fixing bugs in applications, whereas operations (Ops) manage the infrastructure, ensure servers are running smoothly, monitor system performance, and handle deployment. In a DevOps model, both work closely together to streamline the process, automating deployment and ensuring the application runs efficiently in different environments.

6. what is the main purpose of Devops ?

The main goal of DevOps is to improve collaboration between development and operations teams, enabling them to deliver software faster, more reliably, and at higher quality. This is achieved through automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring, leading to shorter release cycles, quicker issue resolution, and a more efficient development process.

7. Explain Git.


8. Explain Github.

GitHub is a web-based platform built on Git that allows developers to host their Git repositories online. It provides tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews. GitHub also integrates with other tools to automate workflows, such as continuous integration and deployment, making it easier to manage large projects.

9. Difference between Centralized version control system & Distributed version control system.

In a CVCS, like Subversion (SVN), all version history and project files are stored in a central server, and developers check out files to work on them. If the central server goes down, work is disrupted. In contrast, a DVCS like Git allows every developer to have a full copy of the repository, including its history. This enables faster local commits and offline work, while also reducing the risk of losing project data.

10. Explain staging area.

The staging area in Git is a middle step between modifying files in your working directory and committing them to the repository. You can stage changes selectively, preparing them for a commit, which allows you to break down changes into smaller, more meaningful commits. It’s essentially a “holding” area where you can review and edit what will be included in your next commit.

11. Explain Branching strategy.
12. Explain Environmentin git.
13. what is stash command.

The git stash command temporarily saves your uncommitted changes without deleting them from your working directory. This allows you to switch branches or work on something else, then return and reapply those changes when needed.

14. what is cherry-pick command.

The git cherry-pick command allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch onto another branch without merging the entire branch. It’s helpful when you want to pick out a bug fix or feature from one branch and apply it to another.

15. what is rebase and merge command.
16. what is commit in github.

A commit is a snapshot of your project’s files at a specific point in time. When you make a commit in GitHub, it records what changes were made and by whom

17. what is terraform.

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that lets you define cloud and on-premise infrastructure using configuration files. It allows you to provision and manage resources like servers, databases, and networking components across multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, using a single language. we use also variable and module to reuse code.

18. advantages of terraform.

Terraform is cloud-agnostic, meaning it works with many cloud providers. It supports version control, making it easier to track infrastructure changes. It also enables automated infrastructure management, provides reusable modules, and uses a declarative syntax to define resources, which ensures consistency across environments.

1. what is cloud ?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as storage, servers, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers or servers, users can access these resources on-demand from cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. It offers flexibility, scalability, and cost savings by only paying for what is used.

Good morning, sir

My name is Guru Devkar, and I'm from Latur. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Commerce in 2022. Currently, I am working at Gremio Technology, where I have gained hands-on experience in LINUX, AWS, and DEVOPS.

In LINUX, I have worked on User Management, Group Management, Redirectors, File permissions, Job scheduling, Archive and Compression, Package Management, Process Management, and Networking.

In AWS, my experience includes IAM, EC2, S3, VPC, Route 53, CloudFront, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch.

In DEVOPS, I have been working with tools such as Git, GitHub, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes (k8s), and Jenkins.
It's all about me....

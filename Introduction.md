## ${\color{red} \textbf{Intro}}$


Hello sir my name is Gurudev Devkar and i'm currently residing in pune. I graduated from SRTM university with a degree in Bachelor of commerce. Since July 2022, I have been working at XYZ company, where I have gained extensive experience in DevOps methodologies, AWS and Linux system administration. 


At XYZ company, my role involved working with the operational part of DevOps. I specialize in bridging the gap between development and operations teams for faster software delivery. 


In the DevOps I have hands on experience with various tools such as Git ad GitHub for version control system where I have managed projects locally with Git functions like branching strategies, staging area, code merging and rebasing and integrate git with CI/CD pipeline for code integration and deployment, and I also use webhook for automated the process of software delivery.


I have also worked with Terraform too build infrastructure on cloud mainly with AWS. I have also worked with variables and modules for reuse my code at any point ass well. And also used provisioners for execute script or command with resource creating then I used s3 backend for secure the tfstate file in s3 bucket.


I used Ansible for configuration management and automation. In that I managed ansible playbook file to run task across multiple servers, then inventory file for manage and organize set of group of hosts.


I have worked with containerization tool like docker to run application and made dockerfiles to create custom images which I pushed it to my Docker Registry. Then created a container and managed multiple container with docker compose then also use docker volume, docker networking.


My main work comes in Kubernetes where I had to manage clusters and its nodes and worked with its objects to deploy pods, replica set and deployment, also managing its network with services like Load balancing and ingress, and also worked with persistent volumes and also work with another object like namespace for isolated environment, used ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage sensitive data DaemonSets, statefulset. 


I also have experience with CI/CD automation tools such as Jenkins, working with pipeline where I managed project lifecycle with Building tool maven, testing toll sonarqube and finally deploying with a web servers like apache, nginx. Also installed and configured Jenkins plugins and  managed credentials. 


Additionally, I used Prometheus and Grafana for continuous monitoring to  application performance and reliability. 
This was my summary of my work in DevOps. 


As for AWS I have experience working with various services of AWS like IAM where I had to manage user-groups and roles, and attach different policies to them. 


I have worked with computing services like EC2 for managing virtual machines, working with launch templates and custom AMI’s to configure instances as per need. I have also worked with  Autoscalling groups and attached Load Balancers with target groups to improve the performance of servers. 


I have also worked with networking services like VPC and Route53 where I have designed custom VPCs and its componants like Subnets, route tables, internet gateway, Nat gateway, Endpoints. Enhanced communication between VPCs with peering Connection.  Transit gateways and VPN for on-promise networks. 


As for Route53 I have managed DNS configuration including domain registration, hosted zones and working with DNS routing policies.


I have worked with database services like RDS and storage services such as EFS and S3 where I managed object storage along with its lifecycle, I hosted a static webpage, and secure the bucket and object with ACL and bucket policies. 
I used SNS for notifications. I configured CloudWatch for metrics, alarms, logs, and dashboards to monitor performance and ensure system health. 


That’s all my work for AWS.


A part from that I have experience handling desktop OS like ubuntu and windows and server OS like CentOS in which I have managed system users and groups, I also experience with Linux like permission management, process management, package management, Redirectors, Job scheduling and also archive and compression for reduse file size. I have also worked with network services like SSH, HTTP, NFS.  Even I have basic understanding of writing shell scripts for automation and creating backups. 


I’m eager to apply my experience to new projects and continue learning in the field of DevOps. I’m looking forward to new challenges and opportunities to grow. Thank you for your time and consideration.

hello sir good afternoon, my name is Gurudev Devkar. im currently residing in pune. i graduated from SRTM university with a degree in bachelor of commerce. since July 2022 i have been working in XYZ company, wherw i have gained extensive experience in devops methodologies, AWS and Linux system administration. 

In XYZ company my role particularly involed with working with operational part of devops. i specialize in bridging the gap between development and operational teams for faster software devlivery. 

in the Devops i have hands on experience with various tools like git and GitHub for version control system where i have managed project locally with git functions like branching strategy, staging areas, code merging and rebasing also integrate git with CI/CD pipeline to code integration and deployment then i also used webhooks for automated the process of software delivery.

then i also worked with Terraform for build the infrastructure on cloud mainly in AWS. and used variable and modules for reuse the code and also provisioners for execute the sript and command when resource creating then i also used s3 backend for secure the tfstate file in s3 bucket.

then i used Ansible for configuration management and deployment in that i have managed ansible playbook file for run multiple task to run task across multiple nodes then inventory file for managed and organize set of group of hosts.

then i used containerization tool like docker to run contarization application and create dockerfile with set of instructions, and pushed it on docker registry, then i also use docker compose for mange multiple containers. i also worked with docker volume and docker networking. 

my main work comes in Kubernetes where i had manage eks cluster and its nodes and works with its objects to deploy pods like replicaSet for manage replicas, Deployment for rollout and rollback the pods, then used services like load balancing and ingress, then used persistant volume depends on project need, and also used configmap and secret to manage sensitive data, and also work with another objects like statefulset, Daemonsets and Namespace for isolated environment. 

i also have experience with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins. in that i worked with pipeline in that i used various tool to project lifecycle like maven for build the code, SonarQube for testing, the use also trivy for scan the docker image and finally deploy with web server like httpd, nginx. i also manage plugins, credentials and nodes.

## ${\color{red} \textbf{HR}}$

hello sir good morning/afternoon i am Gurudev Devkar, i am currently residing in Pune and i have 2.5+ years of experience in INAT technology as a DevOps Engineer. where i have gained extensive experience with DevOps methodology, AWS cloud and Linux system administration. 

in that company my role particularly involved in operational part of DevOps and bridging the gap between developer and operational 
teams for faster software delivery. 

in DevOps i have hands on experience with various tools like git and GitHub for version control system in that i have managed project locally with git functions like branching strategy, staging areas, code merging and rebasing and git integrate with CICD pipeline for code integration and deployment and used webhook for automated the process of software delivery. 

i worked with terraform for building the infrastructure on cloud mainly on AWS, in that i used variable and modules for reuse the code and provisioners for execute the script and command and also used s3 backend for secure the state file. 

used ansible for configuration management and automation in that managed ansible-playbook file for run the task across multiple nodes and inventory file for manage and organise set of group of hosts. 

i worked with containerization tool like Docker to run containerized application and made a Docker files to create custom images and pushed it on docker registry, Then created a container and managed multiple container with docker compose then also use docker volume, docker networking.

my main role comes in Kubernetes in that i had managed EKS cluster with their nodes and deploy the pod with the help of their objects like replica set for manage the pod replicas, deployment for rollout and rollback of version, config map and secret for manage the sensitive data, and also worked with services like ingress , load balancer and persistent volume and also worked with another objects like stateful set, daemon set, namespace for isolated environment. 

Worked with CICD tool like Jenkins where i have wrote a pipeline with multiple stages and managed project lifecycle with multiple tools like maven for build the code, SonarQube for the testing and trivy for the scanning docker images and also in Jenkins i have managed plugins, managed credentials. 

additionally i used Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the application on real time.

as for AWS i have i have experience with multiple services like I am for managing the user, group and roles and policies attach to them. computing services like ec2, networking services like VPC and Route-53 then also storage services like EBS, S3 and EFS, then also RDS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFront and SNS for notification.

i have also experience with Linux like permissions, process, package, job scheduling and Archive and compression and also i have basic understanding of writing shell scripting. 

its all about me.

hello sir good afternoon, my name is Gurudev Devkar. im currently residing in pune. i graduated from SRTM university with a degree in bachelor of commerce. since July 2022 i have been working in XYZ company, wherw i have gained extensive experience in devops methodologies, AWS and Linux system administration. 

In XYZ company my role particularly involed with working with operational part of devops. i specialize in bridging the gap between development and operational teams for faster software devlivery. 

in the Devops i have hands on experience with various tools like git and GitHub for version control system where i have managed project locally with git functions like branching strategy, staging areas, code merging and rebasing also integrate git with CI/CD pipeline to code integration and deployment then i also used webhooks for automated the process of software delivery.

then i also worked with Terraform for build the infrastructure on cloud mainly in AWS. and used variable and modules for reuse the code and also provisioners for execute the sript and command when resource creating then i also used s3 backend for secure the tfstate file in s3 bucket.

then i used Ansible for configuration management and deployment in that i have managed ansible playbook file for run multiple task across multiple nodes then inventory file for managed and organize set of group of hosts.

then i used containerization tool like docker to run contarization application and create dockerfile with set of instructions, and pushed it on docker registry, then i also use docker compose for manage multiple containers. i also worked with docker volume and docker networking. 

my main work comes in Kubernetes where i had manage eks cluster and its nodes and works with its objects to deploy pods like replicaSet for manage replicas, Deployment for rollout and rollback the pods, then used services like load balancing and ingress, then used persistant volume depends on project need, and also used configmap and secret to manage sensitive data, and also work with another objects like statefulset, Daemonsets and Namespace for isolated environment. 

i also have experience with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins. in that i worked with pipeline in that i used various tool to project lifecycle like maven for build the code, SonarQube for testing, the use also trivy for scan the docker image and finally deploy with web server like httpd, nginx. i also manage plugins, credentials and nodes.

Additionaly i used prometheus and grafana for monitoring the application continuously and reliablly.

This was my summary of my work in DevOps. 

as for AWS i have experience with various services of AWS like IAM where i have manages user, group and roles and attach the different policies to them. 

then come to computing service like ec2 where i have managed virtual machine, working with launching templates, and configure AMI for capture the current state of Instance, then worked with autoscaling groups and attached load balancing with target group to improve the performance of servers.

then i have also used networking services like vpc and Route53 wher e i have designed custom VPC and work with its objects like subnets, internet gateway, route table, nat gateway, endpoints, Elastic ip, then enhance the communication between two vpc with peering connection and used transit gateway and VPN for own premises network.

as per Route53 worked with DNS configuration including domain registration, hosted zones and working with DNS routing policies.

then i also worked with database service like RDS and Storage services such as EFS and S3 where i managed object with its storage lifecycle. in that also hosted the static webpage and secure the bucket object with ACL, object lock and bucket policy. then i also used SNS service for notification and configure CloudWatch for matrix, alarms, logs, and dashboards to monitor system health. 

then i also experience with Linux System like handling desktop OS like ubuntu , CentOS and Windows in which have managed system user and groups, then permission management, process management, package management, job scheduling, archive and compressionfor reduse the sile size, redirectors then i also work with network services like SSH, HTTP, NFS.  Even I have basic understanding of writing shell scripts for automation and creating backups.
